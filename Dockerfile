# nodeterm Server Edition — container image (browser canvas backed by the headless server).
#
# The one real trap in here is native-module ABI: the repo's `postinstall` uses electron-rebuild,
# which targets ELECTRON's ABI — but the server runs under plain `node`. So every npm install below
# uses --ignore-scripts and the deps stage runs `server:rebuild` for Node's ABI. Keep the deps and
# runtime stages on the SAME Node major (the compiled binaries must match the runtime ABI).
#
# TLS is terminated by the reverse proxy in front (Dokploy/Traefik, nginx, Caddy…): the server
# speaks plain HTTP inside the Docker network, which is why CMD passes --insecure-http (the
# server refuses a non-loopback bind without it). It sets the Secure cookie flag by itself when
# the proxy forwards X-Forwarded-Proto: https. Do NOT publish the container port directly on a
# public interface.
